- Hi, I’m @Karanvir-Tiwana
- I’m interested in Computational linguistics; OCR, sentiment analysis, and translation, focusing on the Japanese language.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning an object recognition library for an upcoming project, but I hope to be able to apply the skills I develop on
      future linguistics problems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects pertaining to linguistics, or otherwise pertaining to Japanese.
